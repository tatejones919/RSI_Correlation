### Project Description

- Using a divergence in trading is a great way to exploit opportunities.
- One such divergence that is frequently used is the RSI (Relative Strength Index) Indicator.
- The RSI is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset.
- The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100.
- The indicator was originally developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal 1978 book, "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems."
- **The goal of our project will be to create a divergence indicator based on the magnitude of the recent price changes seen in the 30-year T-Bond, 10-year T-Note, and the US Dollar Index (USDX).**

### Research Questions to Answer

- What relationships are seen between the three assets (30-year T-Bond, 10-year T-Note, and the US Dollar Index (USDX)?
- Where can we source the data?
- Are API's available for each asset?

### Datasets To Be Used

- Data sets that contain Bonds Market OHLC data.
- Data sets that contain US Dollar Index OHLC data.
